/*Alice has a bag containing B black balls and W white balls. Alice and bob decide to play a game.
Alice and Bob make alternate moves. Alice makes the first move. 
In each move, the player draws a ball out of the bag. 
If it is a black ball, it is thrown away. 
If it is a white ball, it is put back inside the bag. 
The player who draws the second black ball wins the game. 
You are required to find the probability of Alice winning the game.*/
/*Input
The input consists of a single line containing two integers B (2 ≤ B ≤ 108) and W (0 ≤ W ≤ 108).*/
/*Output
The answer can always be represented as a fraction P⁄Q, where P is an integer and Q is a natural number not divisible by 109 + 7.
Print P · Q-1 modulo 109 + 7.*/
