/*Problem Statement
You are fighting against a monster.
The monster has health M while you have initial health Y.
To defeat him, you need health strictly greater than the monster's health.

You have access to two types of pills, red and green. Eating a red pill adds R to your health while eating a green pill multiplies your health by G.

Determine if it is possible to defeat the monster by eating at most one pill of any kind.*/
